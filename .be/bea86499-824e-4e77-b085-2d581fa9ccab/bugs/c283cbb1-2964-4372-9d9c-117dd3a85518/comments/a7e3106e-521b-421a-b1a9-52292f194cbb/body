Hi folks,

I've noticed that github.com and bitbucket.org offer bugtracking, but
gitorious.org doesn't.  What do you think about attempting to work on
a bugtracker interface for a free code hosting site using BE as the
backend?  An awful lot of people (me included, occasionally!) are
using proprietary sites like github and entrusting their bugtracking
data to it; having a public hosting service that doesn't create a
dependency on that service for your bugtracking data would be pretty
compelling, I think.

The fact that gitorious is written in Ruby on Rails probably makes the
idea of using gitorious in particular a non-starter, but I thought I'd
throw it out there.  There's a gitorious thread about the general idea
here:

http://groups.google.com/group/gitorious/browse_thread/thread/40a541377060cb34

(One way to get around the Ruby/Python problem would be to have the
bugtracker simply operate independently from the rest of the site,
which I suppose would work fine but wouldn't be elegant to use.)

Are there any other popular free code hosting sites out there, perhaps
written in Python?  ;-)  If there was a site that allowed you to
choose between different SCMs, that'd be even more suited to us..

Just an idea,

- Chris.
