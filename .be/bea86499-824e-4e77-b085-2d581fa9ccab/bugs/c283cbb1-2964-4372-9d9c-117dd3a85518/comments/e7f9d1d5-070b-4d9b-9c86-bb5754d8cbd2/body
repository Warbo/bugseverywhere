I've been playing with BE a bit and lurking on this list. I'm a Bitbucket
user, and I like that each project can have source, wiki and bugtracking
associated with it. Now source and wiki are two different plain mercurial
repos. Bugtracking though, has no way to export or import. This is a shame,
since important data is now locked into the site, which ultimately prevents
competition.

I'd be keen for an open source web interface which serves the holy trinity
(source, wiki, bugs) and allows both private and public projects, as the
proprietary sites do. BE seems a natural fit for the bugs component of a
site like this.
