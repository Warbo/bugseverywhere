Another option would be to drive BE in a subprocess via Ruby's IO.popen.
A proof-of-concept implementation could use our standard `be' command.
A production implementation could be either of
  * multi-command BE interface to avoid repeaded repository reloads
    (may be too man process or too much memory for the server)
  * better BE caching for faster reloads
    (more work for us ;)
