Currently one big feature gitorious lacks when compared to github is issue 
tracker. Github issues makes it easy to report issues and map it to commits.
It would be great if Bugs Everywhere can be integrated with gitorious interface
so that every gitorious repo can have a Bugs Everywhere repo with it and can
use gitorious web interface to see and report issues.
