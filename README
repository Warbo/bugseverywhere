Bugs Everywhere
===============
This is Bugs Everywhere, a bugtracker built on distributed revision control.
It works with Bazaar and Arch at the moment, but is easily extensible.  It
can also function with no RCS at all.

The idea is to package the bug information with the source code, so that
bugs can be marked 'fixed' in the branches that fix them.  So, instead of
numbers, bugs have ids.

Getting started
===============
To get started, you must set the bugtracker root.  Typically, you will want to
set the bug root to your project root, so that Bugs Everywhere works in any
part of your project tree.
$ be set-root $PROJECT_ROOT

To create bugs, use "be new $DESCRIPTION".  To comment on bugs, you can can use
"be comment $BUG_ID".  To close a bug, use "be close $BUG_ID".  For more
commands, see "be help".  You can also look at the usage in test_usage.sh.

Using BeWeb, the web UI
=======================
BeWeb uses the Turbogears framework: http://www.turbogears.org/
Please ensure you have Turbogears 0.8a5 or a compatible release installed.
Because it uses BE data, the web UI does not require a database.

To use BeWeb, first create a configuration file, telling it which projects
to track, and what to call them.  An example configuration file 
(beweb/beweb/config.py.example) is provided.

Next, cd to beweb, and run ./beweb-start.py

BeWeb allows you to create, view and edit bugs, but it is in an early stage of
development, so some features are missing.
