Bugs-Everywhere-Web

Configure by creating an appropriate beweb/config.py from
beweb/config.py.example.  The server will edit the repositories that
it manages, so you should probably have it running on a seperate
branch than your working repository.  You can then merge/push
as you require to keep the branches in sync.

This is a TurboGears (http://www.turbogears.org) project. It can be
started by running the start-beweb.py script.
