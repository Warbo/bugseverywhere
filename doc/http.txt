BE bundles Cherry-flavored BE, an interactive HTML interface
originally developed by Steve Losh.

You can run it from the BE source directory with::

    $ python interfaces/web/cfbe.py PATH_TO_REPO

Eventually we'll move it into :py:mod:`libbe.ui` so it will be installed
automatically with every BE installation.
