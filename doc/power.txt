Power features

BE comes with a number of additional utilities and features that may
be useful to power users.  We'll try to keep an up to date list here,
but your best bet may be poking around in the source on your own.

Autocompletion
==============

:file:`misc/completion` contains completion scripts for common shells
(if we don't have a completion script for your favorite shell, submit
one!).  Basic instructions for installing the completion file for a
given shell should be given in the completion script comments.

Packagers should install these completion scripts in their system's
usual spot (on Gentoo it's :file:`/etc/bash_completion.d/`).

XML-handling utilities
======================

Email threads are quite similar to the bugs/issues that BE tracks.
There are a number of useful scripts in :file:`misc/xml` to go back
and forth between the two formats using BE's XML format.  The commands
should be well documented.  Use the usual ``<command> --help`` for
more details on a given command.
