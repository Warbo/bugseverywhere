Welcome to the bugs-everywhere documentation!
=============================================

Bugs Everywhere (BE) is a bugtracker built on distributed version
control.  It works with Arch_ , Bazaar_ , Darcs_ , Git_ , and
Mercurial_ at the moment, but is easily extensible.  It can also
function with no VCS at all.

.. _Arch: http://www.gnu.org/software/gnu-arch/
.. _Bazaar: http://bazaar.canonical.com/
.. _Darcs: http://darcs.net/
.. _Git: http://git-scm.com/
.. _Mercurial: http://mercurial.selenic.com/

The idea is to package the bug information with the source code, so
that bugs can be marked "fixed" in the branches that fix them.
