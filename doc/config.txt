Config file format and location
===============================

Most of the information that BE needs lives in the bug repository
itself, but there is user-specific information that does not fit into
a shared repository.  This per-user configuration information is
stored in an `INI-style config file`__::

  [default]
  user = 'John Doe <jdoe@example.com>'

__ configparser_

The config file is located at :file:`~/.config/bugs-everywhere` by
default, but you can override the path by setting environment
variables (see :py:func:`~libbe.storage.util.config.path` for
details).

Settings
========

Currently the only information stored in the configuration file is a
user ID (see :py:func:`~libbe.ui.util.user.get_user_id`), as shown in
the example above.  However, many version control systems allow you to
specify your name and email address, and BE will fall back to the
VCS-configured values, so you probably don't need to set a BE-specific
configuration.
