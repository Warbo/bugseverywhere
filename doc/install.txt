Installing BE
*************

Bazaar repository
=================

BE is available as a bzr repository::

    $ bzr branch http://bzr.bugseverywhere.org/be

See the homepage_ for details.  If you do branch the bzr repo, you'll
need to run::

    $ make

to build some auto-generated files (e.g. :mod:`libbe._version`), and::

    $ make install

to install BE.  By default BE will install into your home directory,
but you can tweak the ``PREFIX`` variable in ``Makefile`` to install
to another location.

Release tarballs
================

For those not interested in the cutting edge, or those who don't want
to worry about installing Bazaar, we'll post release tarballs somewhere
(once we actually make a release).  After you've downloaded the release
tarball, unpack it with::

    $ tar -xzvf be-<VERSION>.tar.gz

And install it with:::

    $ cd be-<VERSION>
    $ make install


Distribution packages
=====================

Some distributions (Debian_ , Ubuntu_ , others?) package BE.  If
you're running one of those distributions, you can install the package
with your regular package manager.  For Debian, Ubuntu, and related
distros, that's::

    $ apt-get install bugs-everywhere

.. _Debian: http://packages.debian.org/sid/bugs-everywhere
.. _Ubuntu: http://packages.ubuntu.com/lucid/bugs-everywhere
