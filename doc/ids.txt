Object IDs

Format
======

BE IDs are formatted::

    <bug-directory>[/<bug>[/<comment>]]

where each ``<..>`` is a UUID.  For example::

    bea86499-824e-4e77-b085-2d581fa9ccab/3438b72c-6244-4f1d-8722-8c8d41484e35

refers to bug ``3438b72c-6244-4f1d-8722-8c8d41484e35`` which is
located in bug directory ``bea86499-824e-4e77-b085-2d581fa9ccab``.
This is a bit of a mouthful, so you can truncate each UUID so long as
it remains unique.  For example::

    bea/343

If there were two bugs ``3438...`` and ``343a...`` in ``bea``, you'd
have to use::

    bea/3438

BE will only truncate each UUID down to three characters to slightly
future-proof the short user ids.  However, if you want to save keystrokes
and you *know* there is only one bug directory, feel free to truncate
all the way to zero characters::

    /3438

Cross references
================

To refer to other bug-directories/bugs/comments from bug comments, simply
enclose the ID in pound signs (``#``).  BE will automatically expand the
truncations to the full UUIDs before storing the comment, and the reference
will be appropriately truncated (and hyperlinked, if possible) when the
comment is displayed.

Scope
=====

Although bug and comment IDs always appear in compound references,
UUIDs at each level are globally unique.  For example, comment
``bea/343/ba96f1c0-ba48-4df8-aaf0-4e3a3144fc46`` will *only* appear
under ``bea/343``.  The prefix (``bea/343``) allows BE to reduce
caching global comment-lookup tables and enables easy error messages
("I couldn't find ``bea/343/ba9`` because I don't know where the
``bea`` bug directory is located").
