Note for public interfaces that commit after every change:

In the case that some spam or inappropriate comment makes its way
through you interface, you can remove the offending commit XYZ with:
  If the offending commit is the last commit:
    bzr: bzr uncommit && bzr revert
    git: git reset --hard HEAD^
    other VCSs?
  If the offending commit is not the last commit:
    bzr: bzr rebase -r <XYZ+1>..-1 --onto before:XYZ .
      (requires bzr-rebase plugin, note, you have to increment XYZ by
      hand for <XYZ+1>, because bzr does not support "after:XYZ".)
    git: git rebase --onto XYZ~1 XYZ
    other VCSs?
Note that all of these _change_the_repo_history_, so only do this on
your interface-specific repo before it interacts with any other repo.
